            <p>about web design for a good few years now, so I put together the site you see before you.

                If you want to keep up with changes around here, the <a>updates</a> page is the place to be. You could also <a href=""><i class="bi bi-envelope"></i> send me mail.</a>   I maintain a sparsely-updated eponymous <a href="">blog</a> , and if you’re into all that, you can also <a href="">follow me on twitter.</a>

                    If there’s anything here you want to use, all you have to do is email me and ask. I’m a reasonable guy, <a href="#">just be nice</a>. Bear in mind that we probably won’t allow you to republish tutorials from this site on your own, but selective quoting of passages online or in reports for college and so forth is all fine and dandy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any of the code in the tutorials is free to use in your own sites of course, as is the site’s stylesheet. Also, if you want to link to <strong>HTML Source</strong>  or any of the contained tutorials, you’re more than welcome to; there’s no need to ask permission.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    If you have the skills to translate one of the tutorials on this site into another language, please do so! I would love to see more of the articles being translated. You can host the translated copy yourself and I will link to you from the original, so everybody wins.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Teachers of all varieties: if you’d like to print out copies of tutorials to disseminate to your class, feel free to do so. If possible, please add a link to <strong>HTML Source</strong> from your course webpage. <a href="#">Drop me a note</a> and tell me about it if you like. Thanks.
